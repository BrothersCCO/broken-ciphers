### Initial assumptions:
F = W

### Path to solution
The most common letter in the ciphered text was C, so I assumed it was
translated from E. Then, I found the snipped **W_EE_**, which I assumed it was
**WHEEL**. With two more letters, it took just some time to figure out what
the other words and letters were.

### Deciphered and revised text:
I may not be able to grow flowers, but my garden produces just as many dead
leaves, old overshoes, pieces of rope and bushels of dead grass as anybody's,
and today I bought a wheelbarrow to help in clearing it up. I have always
loved and respected the wheelbarrow. It is the one wheeled vehicle of which
I am perfect master
