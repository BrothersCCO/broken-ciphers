### Path to solution
The most common letter in the ciphered text was W, so I assumed it was
translated from E. Then again, I assumed that B was translated from T since
it's the second most common. Now, words started being recognizable, as it was
easy to find **THE** between lots of **T_E**. After discovering that the last
word was **HAPPINESS**, lots of other words became clearer.

### Deciphered and revised text:
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that
they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among
these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these
rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from
the consent of the governed, that whenever any form of government becomes
destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to
abolish it and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such
principles, and organizing its powers in such form as to seem most likely to
effect their safety and happiness.
